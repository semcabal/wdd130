        <p>Hello My name is Sem Cabrera and I'm from Moyobamba, Peru,I'm a driven and inquisitive student excited about
            self-improvement and technology. I am presently learning web development and coding, examining technologies
            such as HTML, Python, Git, and GitHub, while also focusing on enhancing my English skills. I enjoy blending
            discipline and creativity: I play guitar, work out at the gym, and adhere to routines that contribute to my
            physical and mental growth. I take pleasure in transforming challenges into chances and I'm consistently
            excited to acquire new knowledge gradually</p>
